<h1>Bryan's Design Principles</h1>
<div class="container">
    <h2>Key Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Visibility</li>
        <li>Consistency</li>
        <li>Feedback</li>
        <li>Constraints</li>
        <li>Affordance</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Complexity Considerations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The law of Conservation of Complexity: For any system, there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced</li>
                    <li>Use icons, but ensure their meaning is obvious</li>
                    <li>Provide only essential choices to prevent users from feeling overwhelmed, thereby improving the decision-making process.</li>
                    <li>Creating interfaces that users can interact with immediately, learning as they go rather than requiring up-front instruction.</li>
                    <li>Break down complex tasks into simpler, manageable modules. </li>
                    <li>Be as easy as email.</li>
                    <li>Necessity of complexity: Complexity is necessary when an app has a lot of functionality and when the designer want to simplify user's interaction </li>
                </ul>
                </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Cultural Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Universalims Vs Paricularism: Do the users place value on rules, laws, and dogma or they believe the world to be circumstantial?</li>
            <li>Individualism Vs Communitarianism: Do the users believe in in personal freedom and achievement or the group is greater than the individual?</li>
            <li>Specific Vs Diffuse: Are work and personal lives kepts separate or they overlap?</li>
            <li>Neutral Vs Emotional: Do the users make great efforts to express their emotions or to keep them in control?</li>
            <li>Achievement Vs Ascription: Are the usersr valued for what they do or who they are?</li>
            <li>Sequential time Vs Synchronous time: Do the users believe that events happen in a striated sequence or the past, present, and future are an interwoven continuum?</li>
            <li>Internal direction Vs Outer direction: Do the users profess to control nature and environment or the opposite?</li>
            <li>Ensure that interfaces supports multiple languages and is culturally appropriate for different regions.</li>
            <li>Be aware that certain symbols might have different meanings across cultures. Always test icons and symbols with the target audience to ensure they're perceived as intended.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conceptional Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Design the conceptional model purposely, do not let it arise from the technology</li>
        <li>Make sure the mental model and the conceptional model match</li>
        <li>Build user stories or scenarios to represent and understand your users' needs, actions, and the experiences you want to provide.</li>
        <li>Rely on familiar interface patterns to provide a sense of familiarity to users.</li>
        <li>Jakob's law: users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that usrs prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know</li>
        <li>When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Cognitive Design Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Attention</li>
        <ul>
            <li>People may not see what you think your desing is showing them</li>
            <li>How you organize your user interface is important</li>
            <li>People pay attention only to salient <strong>clues</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Perception</li>
        <ul>
            <li>People scan screens based on past experience and expectations</li>
            <li>It is easier to recognize information than to recall it</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Memory</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The more attention tha is paid to somethind, the more likely it is to be remembered</li>
            <li>Good names that help the user remember information</li>
            <li>Search and find tools to help the user with searching.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Human Centered Design Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide discoverability: can a user determine what actions are possible?</li>
        <li>Regularly test your design with real users to gather feedback and insights. </li>
        <li>Utilize a conceptional model</li>
        <li>Adopt an iterative design approach, making improvements based on user feedback and retesting </li>
        <li>Include affordance, signifiers, constraints</li>
        <li>Ensure you have good mappings- the relationship between controls and their actions</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Emotional/ Accessibility/ Errors Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have empathy for our users</li>
        <li>Make feedback immediate</li>
        <li>Ensure that color choices are accessible to those with color vision deficiencies.</li>
        <li>Provide clear error messages that guide users on how to resolve the issue, rather than just indicating that an error occurred.</li>
        
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>DevOps Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Continous Integration: Every day developers are committing codes in a shared repository which is a good development practice.</li>
            <li>Continous Delivery: Any software should be in a releasable state throughout its cycle</li>
            <li>Implement automated testing to ensure that changes to the code don't introduce new errors.</li>
            <li>Manage infrastructure using code and automation, which allows consistent and reliable provisioning of resources.</li>
            <li>Establish mechanisms for fast feedback on the development process, enabling quicker response times to issues.</li>
            <li>Continous Deployment: Every change in each of its developmentphase should pass all automated tests at the time of production.</li>
            <li>Value Stream Mapping: A lean tool that helps in depicting the entire flow of information, material, and works across functional silos including quality and time</li>
            <li>Theory of Constraints: A methodology for identifying the most limiting factor to achieve a milestone and then systematically improving the constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor</li>
        </ul>
