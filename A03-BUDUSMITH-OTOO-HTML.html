                 <td> <strong> Comparing paper-based map and a smartphone map app </strong>. <em> Main metaphors and concepts </em> They both use the concept of locations and routes. Smartphone apps leverage zooming, planning, and location services. <em> Differences </em> Smartphone apps are interactive and offer real-time location plus updates on changes made to whichever place you are going to. <em> New functionality </em> Turn-by-turn navigation and live traffic updates. <em> Pros and Cons </em> The smartphone apps I would say are superior because they provide more up-to-date information and are versatile but the con is its internet and power needs to function. <em> Confusing aspects </em> Digital maps may appear confusing for people who are not too tech-savvy. The different map layers and modes could serve as difficulty. <em> Informed by paper map </em> The basic layout and cartography principles. </td>
